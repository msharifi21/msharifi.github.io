          I bought my first computer when I was in high school. Upon powering up my computer, I was fascinated by this machine. 
          Even though, at the time, I wasn’t fully aware of all the feature and capability of this machine, but I knew it could do amazing things. 
          I started learning computer by installing windows operating system on my machine. 
          The very first night, I installed Windows XP on my computer 6 or 7 times just to try all the different options. 
          Then I started learning Ms. Office applications, Adobe Photoshop, Corel Video Studio and so on… 
          then I decide to turn my hobby into a career, I went after networking and studied Cisco CCNA and Windows Server. 
          My first job was an IT support where I was a one-man IT for a small business, I configured servers, network printers, 
          desktops computers, did routing & switching, and provided user support to the employees. 
          Later on, I realized that I wanted to go farther and learn more which then, I went and got my bachelor in computer science. 
          The learning is not over and it is going to be a life-long journey for me.

          Out of all the software development methodologies that I studied; I like Agile the most. 
          The reason for it is that Agile aligns with my core value and believes. 
          I believe there is nothing more fulfilling than serving others and building a solid strong relationship with my partners in both professional and personal setting. 
          Plus, serving others is the best way to happiness.  
          I believe that Agile and servant leadership should be incorporated into the believes and value of every corporation and small business 
          because success mainly depends on how a business serves its employees and partners. 
          Coachability is another concept that is very important to me as an employee, leader, father, husband and member of community. 
          By coachability I mean being open-minded, being able to listen, care, change, and learn.
