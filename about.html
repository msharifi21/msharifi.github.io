              I am self-motivated, dependable, and a quick learner with great teamwork, problem-solving, and communication skills. 
              I am intellectually curious and have a bachelor's in computer science major in object-oriented programming and architecture. 
              I have a solid knowledge of OOP, software design and architecture, software system engineering and development with a year 
              of experience in IT support where I provided hardware and software installation & configuration support to a small business. 
              I’m passionate about technology and I have self-studied Cisco CCNA and MCITP These two courses provided me with a good 
              understanding of computer networking concepts such as OSI & TCP/IP model, 
              and server administration such as setting up active directory, and file server. <br>
            
              <br> In addition, I have 8 years of experience in customer service, leadership, transportation operations, supply chain & logistics where 
              I provided high-quality customer service to internal & external customers. Led and coached the team of 25 - 30 employees on performance, 
              safety, and compliance analyzed & developed strategies to improve the department’s financial health and performance. 
              Implemented policies, procedures, goals, and objectives and reported the department’s metrics to upper management. 
              And maintained the Trimble PeopleNet, Lytx Drive Cams, and Zebra Scanner for 85 semi-tractors including software & hardware upgrade, installation, and removal. <br>
            
              <br> I’m looking for a career in tech that can challenge me, has room for me to grow, and can help advance my skills in software development and engineering. 
              I’m able to work in a team and individually. I enjoy solving complex problems and motivating others.

          I bought my first computer when I was in high school. Even though at the time, I wasn’t fully aware of all the features and capabilities of this machine but 
          I knew it could do amazing things. I started learning about computers by installing the windows operating system on my machine. 
          The very first night, I installed Windows XP on my computer 6  times just to try all the different options. 
          I was so fascinated by the computer that I was spending most of my free time learning more about it. <br>
          
          <br> Then I started learning Ms. Office applications, Adobe Photoshop, Corel Video Studio and so on… then I decide to turn my hobby into a career, 
          I went after networking and studied Cisco CCNA and Windows Server. My first job was in IT support where I was a one-man IT for a small business, 
          I configured servers, network printers, and desktop computers. I did routing & switching and provided user support to the employees. Later on, 
          I decided to go farther and learn more, and then I went and got my bachelor's in computer science. 
          The learning is not over and it is going to be a life-long journey for me.

          I believe there is nothing more fulfilling than serving others and building a solid strong relationship with my partners in both professional and personal settings. 
          Plus, serving others is the best way to happiness. I believe that servant leadership should be incorporated into the beliefs and values of every corporation 
          and small business because success mainly depends on how a business serves its employees and partners. 
          Coachability is another concept that is very important to me as an employee, leader, father, husband, and member of the community. 
          By coachability I mean being open-minded, being able to listen, care, change, and learn.
