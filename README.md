# Overview 
After I graduated from college, I decided to build myself a website, and make it a place where others can learn more about me! Even though it is not completed yet, I am regularly working to improve it, add content and make it better. Because it provides more information about me, I decided to name it **Subjoinistic**

## [Subjoinistic](https://www.msharifi.tech/)

A personal static portfolio web site that contains four pages: home, about, project and blog.
