            <h3>
              Hello and welcome!
            </h3>
            <p>
              Even though I am a big fan of software engineering and try to spend a lot of time learning and practicing; however, I do other things as well. 
              for example, I like to camp, hike, bike, and edit photos. in addition to those, 
              I also like to write and that is why I have created this page so I can write in my spare time!
            </p>

            <h3>
              The Black Canyon of the Gunnison
            </h3>
            <p>
              A couple of years ago, I had the chance to visit the Black Canyon of the Gunnison and camp there for a few days. 
              Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park exposes you to some of the steepest cliffs, oldest rock, and craggiest spires in North America. 
              With two million years to work, the Gunnison River, along with the forces of weathering, has sculpted this vertical wilderness of rock, water, and sky. 
              Need a mental break? The Black Canyon of the Gunnison disconnects you from the rest of the world as there is no cell signal 
              and you can be on your own to enjoy the cleanest weather, brightest sunlight, and the darkest nights with a sky full of stars. 
              You can easily observe the milky way without a microscope from the top of the canyon at night!

              <h3>
                Life is not a destination… It is a journey! 
              </h3>
              
              <br> When things don’t go the way, we wanted them to go, we get disappointed, feel defeated, and we often bang our heads, kick the dogs, blame others and sometimes blame ourselves. 
                If you are going through this now just remember, life is not a destination… It is a journey! None of us know when and how it is going to end. 
                If you can’t get what you want today, it is not the end of the world! Just remember that life would be meaningless if we instantaneously achieved what we want. 
                It is very important to have goals in life, but it is as important to know that each goal is only a milestone in our journey called life. 
                If you think that you will be happy when you reach a goal, you can’t be more wrong. 
                Now if you disagree with me, think of all those things that were dreams to you in the past that you have now. 
                How happy are you? Just enjoy the moment! Live your life now and think about what you have now that are dreams for others! <br>

                <br> Time is an important requirement for big things to come true; therefore, be patient but don’t give up! Take a break, take a moment to review what you did, 
                go back and reflect on them, and most importantly count what you have now and be grateful for them whatever they are! This is the key.
                
                In addition, never compare yourself with others because our circumstances may look similar but they are as different as our fingerprints. 
                We all go through rough times regardless of our status; therefore, don’t think that you are alone in this. You need to understand that tough 
                times are required for us to improve and grow. If we don’t make mistakes and if we don’t suffer the pain, we will never grow! So, fail, fall, 
                and stand up and fight back! You will grow stronger, you will win! Just don’t give up! <br>

                <br> Remember life is a journey It has its beauty and its challenges overall it is beautiful!
